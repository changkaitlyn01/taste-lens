=== Restaurant: Sidecar Doughnuts, Costa Mesa ===

Been wanting to come for at least a decade, but I don’t live in state. I was finally in town and close enough to stop by, and I was a bit disappointed.
They were out of many flavors I wanted to try (not their fault), and the huckleberry doughnut had an aftertaste of dirty/tap water.
The banana bread latte was good for an iced drink, but has the very slightest banana taste, way too subtle.
Don’t think I’ll come back, but I’m sure people who love cake doughnuts will enjoy it enough.

I drove 45 minutes to try Sidecar Donuts, and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment ever. The donuts were bitter, doughy, and completely flavorless.honestly the worst donuts I’ve ever had. They tasted like they were made with old oil or overcooked, which probably explains the bitterness.
On top of that, the staff looked unprofessional their aprons were filthy, and no one even smiled or seemed to know what was inside the donuts they were selling. For a place that’s supposed to be premium this was unacceptable.
I did get a refund after calling, but that doesn’t make up for the wasted time and effort. I genuinely regret trying their donuts. If you want real flavor and freshness, try JD Flannel Donuts same price or less, and so much better
—
Amazing donuts, the cake style is perfectly fluffy with a slight crisp. They have samples which is an added perk. The service is great but the store is a bit cramped. Definitely a grab and go situation!
—
The donuts at Sidecar are on another level! Fluffy, fresh, and perfectly made. The chocolate donut is rich in flavor, and the Saigon cinnamon one is absolutely addictive. It is warm, fragrant, and just the right amount of sweetness. I recently tried the passion fruit - wow! It’s like eating a mini cake. It was sooo delicious!
It’s definitely a “fancy donut” place, but you can really taste the quality in every bite. If you’re looking for a treat that feels special (and totally worth the splurge), this is the spot.
The staff is always so nice here. There is plenty of parking.
—
A MUST! Found this place via social media influencer, showed up ten minutes after opening, and there was a line out the door. Customer service was brilliant, and the atmosphere was electric. A serious consideration needs to be made for their catering based on their products and customer service. The donuts to buy: hazelnut (no matter what), then the bacon maple, the salt and butter, and the Oreo. Whoever, not a single donut was bad. You can taste the quality of ingredients they use.
—
What can I say — a solid experience. Good selection, fresh products, and definitely a doughnut shop worth keeping in mind. Some flavors stand out more than others, but overall it’s a place I would return to when I’m in the mood for something sweet and well-made.
—
VERDICT: Excellent donuts with impeccable style and flavor. A must-try.
FOOD: There are no gimmicks here with the unique styles of donuts, but rather excellent execution. The balance of gentle sweetness, richness, and saltiness of the butter & salt donut squarely demonstrates this shop's expertise in the art of the pastry. It can't be overstated that this shop dodges the pitfall of overwhelming sweetness, best displayed in the salted caramel donut and the passion fruit donut, which temper sweetness in favor of full-bodied flavor.
DRINK: Their coffee serves as a perfect companion to the donuts. While not stellar, it is still quite enjoyable and may have been a killer coffee, but who's-to-know when the donuts are guaranteed to steal the show.
SERVICE: The team was kind, prompt, and a joy to work with. Perhaps my child-like excitement helped my cause, but if you don't have child-like excitement being taken into the audience of a royal donut spread like this, your soul may be dead.
ATMOSPHERE: Americana-meets-French. A poignant memory of Paris for me will always be the bustle of a cramped patisserie. This place hits those notes but with a refreshingly American twist by offering a coffee and slowing the vibe a couple notches while still maintaining the excitement of imminent indulgence.

Best donuts in SoCal 💗All the donuts taste great except the cookies & cream. All donuts are made fresh and have the perfect sweetness levels. The coffee portions are pretty small but taste good. Must try!
—
I get why there are so many posts on social media. First time there, and couldn’t help but pick a bunch. I prefer cake style donuts like these with some bite, not the overly airy type. They are not greasy either, where if you smash them in between a paper napkin it makes the paper all translucent. I got my the huckleberry (favorite), 3 assorted donut holes (great for trying 3 flavors), old fashioned (top contender), vanilla glazed (classic), jalapeño butter cornbread (I love cornbread, expected more cornbread texture). There were others I wanted to try but they didn’t have any, including the savory puffs
—
The best doughnuts you'll ever have are right here. And I've been to portland. I highly recommend the butter and salt. My favorite is the strawberry buttermilk, but it's not available year round. They also have weekly new flavors, there's always a gluten free option, and the coffee is pretty great too. I recommend ordering ahead on the app and just picking up since there can be a line on weekend mornings.
—
Shrinkflation! The cake donuts used to be so big. I can’t believe how small the doughnuts are compared to three years ago! I used to be so fond of this place, and now I’m thoroughly disappointed. It’s very bad value and does not justify the expensive price.
—
This place has been on my list to try for quite some time. I was in the area this morning so I stopped in and picked up half a dozen. There is a good amount of parking, the store is clean and well decorated. The staff are friendly and welcoming.
Based on the reviews I was expecting some of the best donuts of my life, unfortunately they were as mediocre and mediocre gets. For $4.83 a piece these aren't worth it. The texture wasn't great, kind of doughy and gum like, and the flavors were just ok. Once was enough for me.
—
Best donut place in the area! The passion fruit one was so good with the jam filling and the cream on top. Not dry at all!
Would definitely come again.
—
Doughnuts were yummy but coffee needs a bit of work but it’s not bad. Ordered online for pickup and since it was my first time picking up from this place, the instructions were a bit vague. There was a long line when I walked in and didn’t know where to pickup. I saw there was a cart that said “pick up” but you had to ask the cashier to get it for you. I waited a while until the cashier finally gave it to me. Kinda wish there were clearer pickup instructions.
—
Great service and amazing donuts. The huckleberry was unreal! I can’t wait to go back for it. Old fashioned was mid. Will definitely be back for more.
—
The donuts here are so fresh and the dough itself is so full of flavors it doesn't need to be as sweet on the outside to be amazing. There is a large assortment of choices, but we tried the Basil Eggs Benedict (only available until 11:30 AM), the old fashion donut, and Expresso. The donuts were on the larger side, but every bite is packed with flavor and a satisfying texture. Also if you want something more savory than sweet, the Basil Eggs Benedict is a fantastic choice. Everyone in my family said it was some of the best donuts they have ever had.
It can get really busy in the mornings but they have a large staff working and the line moves pretty fast. If you know what you want ahead of time, the mobile/online order system is a great option. The mobile order shelves are on the left when entering. And because most people were taking orders to go, parking tends to free up pretty quickly.
—
I would give this place a 1000 stars if I could. It is hands down the best doughnut in the world. Everything about it is just perfect, none of them are sickly sweet, they all have a generous amount of filing and flavour so that every bite is great. The butter and salt is incredible but you should try everything. The lemon pound cake has become my favourite doughnut of all time. The huckleberry, celebration cake and old fashioned are all great.
—
Delicious. There are donuts and then there are donuts. Had a co-worker bring these in for a tasting, and a tasting we did. The donuts were soft, flavorful and extremely fresh. The texture did a delightful dance on my tongue as I indulged in the Maple Bacon and Huckleberry choices. Most donuts either fall on the dense side, oily, imitation flavored or just plain tasteless. Was pleasantly surprised to see such a wonderful flavor palette offered here. The bacon maple could have errored on the side of a bit more maple, but great nonetheless. Looking forward to trying more flavors very soon.
—
I’ve heard so much about Sidecar Donuts, and I finally got to try them myself—wow. Hands down, the best donuts I’ve ever had in my life. Super fresh, warm, and absolutely flawless. I tried the Old-Fashioned and the Lemon Pound Cake, and while both were incredible, the Old-Fashioned was on another level. Pure perfection. This place is officially a must-visit every time I’m in Newport!🍩
—
I tried Sidecar donuts for the first time today. These were some of the BEST donuts I’ve ever had! We got 8 flavors and they were all amazing! Each donut was fluffy and fresh. Highly recommend!
—
Sidecar Donuts in Costa Mesa is a delightful little shop that’s worth a visit for any donut lover. The open kitchen concept allows you to watch the skilled bakers craft each donut with care, a mesmerizing spectacle that adds to the overall experience.
The donuts themselves are simply divine. From classic glazed to creative and seasonal flavors, there’s something to satisfy every palate. The dough is fluffy and perfectly cooked, and the toppings are generous and flavorful.
The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with friendly staff who are always willing to help. Whether you’re grabbing a quick bite or indulging in a sweet treat, Sidecar Donuts is the perfect place to satisfy your cravings.
—
Not my kind of donuts, but my wife likes it. Very busy place. The Passion Fruit Donut was pretty good. Got me all sugared up!!
—
Some of the best doughnuts I've ever had! I went on a Saturday morning and the line was out the door. The employees were friendly and efficient so the line moved quickly. I bought the old fashioned and chocolate yeast, both of which were fresh and warm. The chocolate was delicious but the old fashioned was outstanding! I can't wait to go back.
—
I have always loved Sidecar mainly for the Maple Bacon. Just went there this morning and was told they only serve Maple Bacon on Wednesdays now. People were literally walking out without buying anything. I hope the best for Sidecar but cannot fathom the logic behind this decision.
The staff is great and was doing their best to accommodate the frustrated customers.
—
A must try if you’re into cake donuts. Their seasonal flavors can be very fun and tasty! But my all time go to is the old-fashioned and huckleberry donut. Coffee is also decent. I must say that their boxes are a bit too long to carry conveniently.
—
The best donuts I’ve ever had. Most boutique donut shops are quite “average” donuts with the addition of extraordinary toppings. This makes for an entertaining experience but it’s just not that tasty. These Sidecar donuts are a different story. The base donut itself is fundamentally different from anything else’s I’ve had and the glazes, fillings, and toppings elevate them to yet another level. These are foundationally set apart and are incredible.
—
This is another Great place to visit and stock up while I'm in town. A total local spit of Newport Beach CA. New Seasonal flavors and Gluten free flavors of the week. Make sure to sign up for Sidecar Rewards. Just got a free donut with points. Come early and plan to wait on weekends in a line, but so worth it. I visit this place a couple of times when I'm in town. Just Go!
—
Not that Sidecar needs another review but here I go ;P It's always a 5-star for me. Their donuts are yummy, their service is excellent...just be prepared to stand in line and sometimes you need to do a few loops if parking. They make a pretty good cup of coffee (for the Stumptown fans), but let's be honest...it's ALL about the donuts! Their gluten free and vegan options are my thing and they rarely disappoint. The vegan flavor changes monthly and the gluten free weekly (I think). If you're a local, you've already gone, I'm sure. If you're visiting, definitely pop by. The place already has icon status in my book <3
—
So delicious fresh Doughnuts served hot
Wide variety of choices
Highly recommended to try
All what was tried was really good
Old fashioned recommended as well
Hot and fresh with no preservatives 👍🏻
—
I must admit, I've never been much of a fan of cake donuts, but Sidecar Donuts has quickly and decisively changed my opinion. These donuts are nothing short of life-changing, and I've found myself returning multiple times to indulge in their delectable treats.
The presentation of the donuts is absolutely stunning, making it nearly impossible to resist trying them all. I strongly recommend visiting early in the day when the donuts are fresh and at their most delicious. Be sure to finish them on the same day to savor the full experience.
Out of all the incredible options, I cannot recommend the blueberry pancake batter donut highly enough. It's packed with real blueberries, providing an authentic flavor that will delight anyone's taste buds. This donut truly embodies the essence of a blueberry pancake, and it's a must-try for anyone visiting Sidecar Donuts.
If you're looking for a truly unforgettable donut experience, look no further than Sidecar Donuts. Their irresistible offerings will have you coming back for more, and you may just find yourself, like me, a newly converted cake donut enthusiast.


=== Restaurant: Bear Flag Fish Co., Newport ===

Bear Flag in Newport Beach is one of those places that consistently delivers, whether you’re stopping in for a quick bite or sitting down to enjoy a full spread with friends. The vibe is casual, beachy, and welcoming, and the staff keeps things moving while still being friendly and helpful.
The Bear Flag Burrito is a must-order—packed, flavorful, and perfectly balanced. Everything tastes fresh, and the ingredients really shine without being overcomplicated. The ahi burrito was another standout: clean, fresh, and cooked just right, with great texture and flavor in every bite.
We also tried the oysters, which were fresh and briny, and the clam chowder, which was rich, comforting, and not overly heavy—perfect for a coastal spot like this. Even the pizza impressed, making it clear that Bear Flag goes beyond just seafood and does it well.
To top it off, the drink selection paired perfectly with the food. The Pizza Port Chronic Amber and Sully Ale were both solid choices and rounded out the meal nicely.
Overall, Bear Flag Newport Beach hits all the marks: fresh food, great variety, solid drinks, and a relaxed atmosphere that fits the location perfectly. A reliable go-to spot whether you’re a local or just visiting the area.

Solid fish joint serving up fresh poke bowls, tacos, and burritos.
Two public Parking lots are available.
One cost $10 for the hour and the other is free.
Inside there is a good amount of seats but the place gets packed quickly. Expect to look for seating. Outside patio seating plus courtyard increases chances.
They have a bar with limited seats.
A seafood market selling fresh fish by the lb.
The line was coming out the door but went rather quickly. You order at the counter, and are given a number.
Pricing wise it’s premium.
Poke Bowl is a hit.
I can see why people rave about it.
Guac was absolutely delicious.
Food is fresh.
But it’s not delivered to your table all at once which caused us issues.
Missing fish tacos. By the time I got them they were cold :( They were just okay as the breading/seasoning were lackluster.
Missing garlic crisps for poke bowl. Had to ask for them as well. The crisps really changed the depth of the bowl and had excellent flavor.
Tip: Get rice as the base instead of the salad.
4/5 stars. Minus one star for missing essential order items.

Following my recent eye surgery, I was excited for my first movie outing. The Lido Theater was showcasing a new release, “The Lost Bus,” which prompted us to dine at a nearby restaurant prior to the screening.
The ambiance and proximity to Newport Bay were undoubtedly captivating rendering the food quality almost secondary. Nevertheless, I found the Bear Flag Burrito with chips and salsa to be enjoyable. The tortilla was soft but well-rolled giving it excellent structural integrity. The panko-crusted white fish was nicely contrasted to the tangy crema, which had a smoky and spicy kick. Was that the Tommy sauce? The harmonious incorporation of classic filling ingredients(rice, black beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, avocado)provided the burrito’s great taste yet maintaining a light and refreshing quality. The portion size is substantial, and I recommend sharing or portioning it for later consumption. A charming patio area outside the restaurant served as an ideal setting for a late-summer meal.
—
The halibut was so fresh but the real star of the dish was the sautéed vegetables. Could've had a whole plate of those! Atmosphere was very cozy without losing quality. Loved our La Bamba sushi roll and everything was brought to our table in a good time frame. Staff was friendly and they had a clear gluten free menu options list at the counter. There's an outdoor eating area as well. Definitely would come here again!
—
Wonderful local fresh fish eatery with great ocean vibe! The fish is fresh, everything is delicious from the chowder to the bowls to the sushi! The staff is incredibly accommodating and don't miss the exquisite cocktails.
—
They are so much better than California Fish Grill! I wish they had one near where I lived. I would eat here regularly. Lots of really delicious options for low-carb diets, which is incredibly hard to find. I had the salmon with sautéed veggies and an avocado. I also loved their tea. Even my youngest (6 years old) loved it. A couple of things to consider: drinks besides tea and water are not refillable like other restaurants, and it's really cramped. Decent for party sizes up to maybe 4 people (we had 6 and it was hard to sit together). The black beans aren't seasoned with much more than maybe a tiny bit of salt. I took a bite of my husband's beans. They're good! But not typical black beans. Service is good! Employees seem happy to work here, though they have some trouble helping with answering menu and ordering questions, but they're cheerful and try to find someone who knows the answer, but it can hold up the line and I felt a little awkward because I needed those answers due to dietary restrictions. While most of the restaurants we ate at in NB were very good, this is the only one I ate at twice during my stay because it was so delicious with tons of low-carb options and very affordable. Definitely recommend for smaller parties.
—
Delicious food! And reasonable prices with large portions.
It’s not a traditional restaurant atmosphere — more of a fish market vibe with both indoor and outdoor seating. Counter service, with food brought to your table.
I got the large fish plate and my wife got the small. We also shared a calamari plate. We both were stuffed.
Personally, I did not feel like the portion size for the calamari was large enough for the price, but the main courses we ordered more than made up for it.
I highly recommend this spot for delicious seafood with a great selection at reasonable prices. If I were local, I’d definitely be back.
—
Visited in the recommendation of a friend and it didn’t disappoint! We got poke bowls to go. Absolutely delicious.
Line was out the door but the service was fast and friendly.
—
Really good and fresh poke. The chips are very necessary. A lot of hype around this place, and it’s good! Probably stay with the fresh stuff. I got their cioppino too which was not good at all - watery and bland.
—
I had the bear flag taco which was ok (plain), the yellowtail taco which was good, caterpillar roll which was good and Smokey bear cocktail which was good. I didn’t taste anything excellent, but staff are friendly. Prices are what you expect for seafood. Very popular place so crowded but surprisingly the wait in line is not too long and there’s usually a few tables open, even on Sat afternoon. There’s an outdoor patio area with umbrellas.
—
This is an excellent choice if you are looking for casual fish options.
They feature a variety of fish options available as an entree with sides or in tacos.
They also have sushi, poke, guacamole, chips and salsa. Full bar as well.
Order at counter, get your number and they bring it out to you. Enjoy.
—
Looooooooove bear flag. YOU SHOULD GO THERE! poke, guacamole and salsa were so fresh and tasty. The clam chowder and tacos were great as well.
—
Best place for see food lovers ahi poke mostly recommended but everything else taste delicious too ( fish tacos, burritos, salads, sushi rolls) its a must try!
—
I typically go to Bear Flag Fish company once a month. I love their burrito and ceviche. This time I ordered sushi but it was not that impressive. I would not order sushi here. Overall it’s a good seafood restaurants with reasonable prices. I would go back again.
—
There’s better poke place, not worth it. For the plate, the fish is alright but the sides are meh.
—
I don't typically go for seafood but this place does it so so well. The fish tastes incredible and you can really taste it in the dishes they prepare. I had a burrito and my gf got a poke bowl. Both were incredible and I'd gladly come back. The shop is very cool and you can even buy fresh seafood. Lots of outdoor seating and some indoor as well. There was a line at lunch but it moved quickly. Staff was helpful and pleasant.
—
The food was excellent. The outside atmosphere is nice tucked away in a private courtyard away from traffic with nice table and counter seating. Enjoyed all the tacos, but the poke tacos were especially flavorful. Tuesday was taco Tuesday with $3 Bear Flag tacos (breaded white fish).
—
The bear flag taco was really good, but loved the specialty taco with shrimp! They have a nice patio area in the back. Definitely planning to go back.
After going back, got the fish burrito. It was a decent size & very good. They also have very good kid options.
—
So, I was so hungry I forgot to add pictures of my actual food! This is a great counter- service restaurant that is fast when you need something good but quick. Not a lot of presence but really good fish and a decent menu. I had the clam chowder and grilled artichoke. The clam chowder was good, I’d have it again and the grilled artichoke was great. The fresh fish looked fantastic. Unless you want alcohol, the drink selection isn’t very extensive. The line moves pretty fast and the food comes out in a decent amount of time.
—
CAUTION: Once you’ve had Bear Flag, you’ll never want to go to another poke shop in Orange County!
This place is known for its Tuna or Salmon sold by the pound. No need to buy a cup of rice or anything because it actually comes with a bag of house made tortilla chips as well!
There are 2 locations: 1 in crystal cove and 1 on lido ave. If you come to the lido location, good luck finding parking. I do recommend buying the order online before picking up so a friend can drop you off with hazard lights on so you can get it and go.
You can also order sides by the pound or quarter pound, as pictured below. I got seaweed salad and cucumber salad both as 1/4 lb. I highly recommend the seaweed salad as the sesame oil tastes absolutely amazing with it. The cucumber salad I would probably skip the next time but its accompanying dressing wasn’t bad either.
Overall, definitely not the last time I’ll be visiting so I am excited to try the rest of their menu!
—
Big fish burrito (butter and garlic seabass) - next time looking forward to trying it blackened, probably more flavor. Very black bean heavy. Awesome vibes! Loved the fresh seafood case.
—
Let me be honest, I had the best sushi roll so far. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll and also had some delicious fried calamari, which was really fresh. Highly recommended indeed!
—
Good, not great. The side of veggies was very bland and obviously not sautéed, which is what I asked for. I got the bluefin tuna, which was good, but again not great. However the poke and chips were fantastic. Also fun having Asahi on tap
—
10/10 would recommend, but you knew that already. We got guac with the poke and that was a great combo. Also upgraded to the premium fish in the burrito and I’d highly recommend that if you can.
—
Really awesome place for seafood in southern california. We stopped here a few times during our stay to restock on fresh fish in our bellies. The portions of fish are quite generous, and the flavors are awesome. I suggest getting salmon or tuna bowl with rice. Hot chili crunch is the bomb.
—
Wow... disappointing. We went here for my husbands birthday and this could be the worst sushi we've eaten and we even ate sushi in grand junction Colorado so we've had bad sushi. Obviously this is a fish restaurant but I just figured the sushi would be edible?! The roll was the only thing we got that was good (la bamba roll). Everything else (salmon plate, ono burrito, salmon nigiri and the bluefin tuna) was plain, nothing above standard and the sushi was almost inedible. Would highly NOT recommend. Oh also it took an hour to get our food.
—
Its BEAR FLAG cannot go wrong! Expensive, but its because its fresh catches! Sweet customer service
Workers always willing to hook you up with bigger plate for free or bag of chips for free! Definitely get the guacamole and poke!!! THIS is THE poke spot! Also the blackened sword fish burrito with their special sauce?! MMMMM perfect!!! Load on the guacamole?! Yes! Grew up eating FRESH sea food. This is want you want if looking for FRESH and delicious.... also can watch the games inside or sit outside with a beautiful fountain! Great for kids too!
—
customer service at the counter was horrible. rude girl, wouldn’t check for inventory, then proceeded to tell others inventory was available.
when food was forced as to go order, 4 of the employees played toss the bag around for about 5 minutes before calling names-order cold.
at least 6 other customers complained as they were standing around from the counter girls attitude…
very disappointed from ordering to exiting. never returning to this location again, wish i went somewhere else for dinner.
—
Bear Flag Burrito was delicious! The ingredients were fresh, nice flavors and the panko-crusted whitefish was tasty with the 2 Bear Flag sauces. Service was quick for dine out. Beautiful view of the ocean. Would definitely come back again for this burrito.
—
Delicious food at more than fair prices with beautiful views of the ocean. They validate parking (free for two hours) in the garage. Only downside-it can get very crowded. The food is worth the wait-but prepare to wait a bit. What’s the rush? You’re in California!


=== Restaurant: Habana, Costa Mesa ===

Our group came in here for a weekend brunch and were seated inside with a lovely view of their outdoor patio. It's beautiful decorated and service was great.
They weren't busy yet so we had the place to ourselves for a little bit. The food and drinks was delicious and beautifully presented. The portions were good as well. We will definitely be back.
—
I had a great experience! Our waiter was so nice and kept checking up on us, and they even gave us complimentary rosé. We were seated outdoors with dim lights which made the ambiance warm and cozy.
What we ordered:
- Chicken Empanada (9/10): Smaller than I expected, but so delicious. The sauce it came with was amazing.
- Ropa Vieja (9/10): The beef was tender, flavorful, and paired perfectly with the rice, beans, and sweet plantains.
- Medianoche Sandwich (8/10): Tasty, but nothing too special. The fries that came with it were really good though.
Overall, great service, great food, and a really nice vibe!
—
Delicious food, plenty of options and a great outdoor ambience. We chose the restaurant to celebrate a few birthdays and were greeted with complimentary champagne and we also got a sweet Happy Birthday wish on a pretty Souvenir postcard. We all got different dishes including the seafood paella, churrascaria, fliet mignon, ahh tuna and salmon dinners. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We were stuffed so we didn't get dessert, but will definitely make room for the next time. We walked off the calories as we walked around the stores around the area.
—
We celebrated New Year Eve dinner at Cafe Habana. Loved the music,dance & ambience. We loved their delicious food & server was excellent.
—
I had such a wonderful experience at Habana in Costa Mesa! This restaurant offers brunch, lunch, and dinner, and it has a beautiful atmosphere with an outdoor seating area that includes heaters. The ambiance is just so fun and vibrant! I especially love the Costa Mesa location because of its unique setting in a charming shopping center.
What really stood out to me was how perfect it is for weekend brunch. Unlike many other places where you have to wait in long lines and deal with crowds, Habana is much more relaxed. If you go around 11 a.m., parking is easy and there’s no wait to be seated. The service is top-notch, and the food is absolutely delicious!
If you’re celebrating a birthday and make a reservation through Google, they even add a special touch by placing a birthday card under the guest’s name, which is such a lovely gesture.
A big shoutout to our server, Maria, who was so attentive and kind. She offered us rosé, but we stuck with brunch and enjoyed every bite.
I highly recommend trying the French toast, it’s not overly sweet and has a unique twist that makes it really special. They’re also super accommodating with special requests, so I always get a side of egg whites for that extra protein.
Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I can’t wait to go back!
—
We sat at the bar for a post-dinner snack but went all in with 4 dishes & 2 cocktails (go big or go home).
Food & Drinks:
The food overall was good, though the corn was just okay. Cocktails looked great, but ours only got about a shake & a half before being poured, which left them a little underwhelming.
Service & Experience:
Service was definitely lacking. While we were in the middle of ordering, the bartender twice diverted her attention to talk to someone else & even said goodbye to a group leaving before turning back with, “I’m sorry, so…you said the corn & what?” Not the smoothest service moment
Atmosphere & Overall:
The space still has that Havana-inspired charm & energy we remembered from before, but the execution this visit fell short. Since we’ve been here years ago and enjoyed it, we’ll chalk this up to maybe a long night for the staff & give them another try in the future.
—
Went to Habana in Costa Mesa for the second time — and it did not disappoint. I had gone with friends the first time and instantly knew I had to bring my husband. He finally got to try it, and yep, he absolutely loved it too. The food is just incredible — hands down the best Cuban food we’ve had in Southern California. The drinks were spot-on, and the service was super friendly and attentive. Honestly, everything about this place is five-star. We’ll definitely be back again!
—
Habana at The Lab Anti-Mall is a true gem! The paella seafood rice is absolutely delicious – full of rich flavors and perfectly cooked. The Grilled Prawns salad was fresh, light, and excellent. But the real standout is the sautéed shrimps in white wine sauce with cherry tomatoes – an absolute must-have dish! The atmosphere is vibrant and unique, making it the perfect spot for a memorable meal. Highly recommend if you’re in Costa Mesa!
—
This place is a little harder to find than I would like but the food and service are very good. It has to be one of the best places to get Cuban food in the area. It took me back to the Cuban flavors in Miami but here, they are a bit more mild. The prices are a little bit high for the level of food you are getting and the location but I will definitely be coming back.
—
I finally had the chance to visit Habana at The Lab in Costa Mesa, and it lived up to the hype! From the moment you walk in, the lively ambiance sets the tone--warm lighting, rustic charm, and a vibrant, bustling energy that makes you feel like you're on a little escape.
The Food
The mac & cheese was rich, creamy, and indulgent with bits of ham adding a nice salty bite. Comfort food at its best, served sizzling hot in a cast-iron skillet.
The ropa vieja (shredded beef in tomato sauce) came with onions and toasted bread--super flavorful, tangy, and satisfying, especially paired with the bread for scooping.
The empanadas were golden and flaky, with perfectly seasoned fillings. Each one had a nice crisp bite and came with a dipping sauce that tied everything together.
Drinks & Atmosphere
They have an impressive cocktail list with mojitos and rum-based drinks that fit the Cuban theme perfectly. The vibe is lively but cozy--perfect for date night or a fun dinner with friends.
Service
The staff was welcoming and attentive without being overbearing. Food came out quickly, and everything felt fresh and thoughtfully prepared.
Overall, Habana is a gem in Costa Mesa for when you're craving bold, flavorful Cuban food in a fun, upbeat atmosphere. I'll definitely be back to try more dishes (and maybe sneak in one of their desserts next time).
—
Second time here. Yawni had been an approachable manager to whom we can talk to freely. She's amazing! She is a UCR Alum and I work at UCR so we have that connection. The food and drinks are worth the hour drive to this gem. Paella with Lobster and Ropa Vieja, smoked old fashion and the piña colada with the rum float was worth the drive out here. Missing 2 stars for Andrea the bartender who could be more friendly to us at the bar as it wasn't so busy. She was extra friendly with the young guy at the bar who came alone and she was extra friendly and personal with him. We love to get to know our bartenders and staff. We didn't get that opportunity with her. She still checked on us at the minimum with an unfriendly face. Tawni thank you for the friendliness and we love to see you. We will still be back and recommend this gem.

Habana is modern Cuban finer dining executed with precision and love. While the menu prices seem high, the quality of the food justifies the prices. If you come for lunch, try the 3 course fixed prices menu. You get several choices for starters and mains and 2 dessert options. We went for the chicken and the short rib hash, and both were excellent. The outdoor dining space is remarkably isolated from the parking lot and the music transports you to Cuba. We will return to try more of the excellent menu.
Update August 2025: We have returned several more times and never been disappointed. Food remains great, service is friendly and every entree delivered satisfaction.

I’m not sure where the 4.8-star rating comes from. The portions are tiny and the prices are outrageous. While the food does taste good, the overall experience felt like a scam. The drinks are overpriced, and there’s no restroom inside — you have to go outside and share bathrooms with the rest of the plaza. The service is just okay, nothing special. I left very disappointed, especially because I came from far away based on the glowing reviews. Definitely not worth it in my opinion.

Wonderful little restaurant, great atmosphere, attentive service, free mini champagne on entrance, food was excellent, drinks were delicious, I have the smoky Cubans delicious! Definitely recommend for date night of friends intimate dinner, not a kid/family vibe in my opinion. Perfect for friends or couples

We had the most incredible Christmas dinner at Habana Costa Mesa. The pre-fix menu was a masterpiece! Every dish was bursting with flavor, from the vibrant appetizers to the succulent main courses. The chicken and plantains were an absolute standout – perfectly cooked and seasoned. And let's not forget the flan – it was simply divine! The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was warm and inviting. It truly was a perfect Christmas evening. Highly recommend!

Beautiful ambience, dog friendly and excellent food. Although it’s definitely on the pricier side. My favorite is roasted chicken and side of plantains. My friends ordered cheese tamale and empanadas and they all loved it. Only downside is parking in this mall is always difficult and even if you find a parking, the stalls are very narrow so most likely get your car door dinged.
But that’s not restaurants fault. I enjoyed their latin music and beautiful vacation like vibe.

Loved it there! The food was delicious, cocktails were creative, and staff was so friendly and attentive. It was really nice for the floor manager to even come by our table and talk to us for a bit

We celebrated my fiancée’s birthday at Habana in Costa Mesa and had a great time! The outdoor seating was cozy with trees and heat lamps. We ordered the Chicken Empanadas, Ropa Vieja, and Lechón Asado — everything was delicious and full of flavor. The service, atmosphere, and food made it a perfect night. Definitely coming back!

From appetizers to desserts, this restaurant exceeded our expectations!
The seafood dish I ordered, LA PAELLA, was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.
The cozy outdoor seating area with rustic decor, soft lighting and music makes it a perfect spot to unwind.
The service was impeccable from start to finish. The staff was friendly, attentive but at the same time not intrusive. Truly great service!
Finding parking was not as easy with no option of valet so you just need to make sure to arrive 10-15 early.
Overall everything was exceptional and I would definitely come back.

We came to Habana in Costa Mesa to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and it did not disappoint! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious — from the chicken empanadas to the Lechón, Salmon a la Parrilla, and garlic chicken. The plantains were perfectly cooked, and the black beans and rice were full of flavor. Even our kids couldn’t get enough — they loved it too!
What really made the experience special were the little touches, like the complimentary rosé wine. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. We felt right at home.
Highly recommend for a great night out or a special occasion. We’ll definitely be back!

We came to Habana at the LAB in Costa Mesa for their special Mother’s Day Brunch, and it was truly a 5-star experience from start to finish. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted at the host stand with a complimentary glass of rosé—a classy and thoughtful touch that immediately set the tone for a memorable meal.
The brunch menu was prix fixe at $85 per person, which included a starter, an entrée, and a dessert. Every dish we tried was flavorful, beautifully presented, and clearly made with quality ingredients.
Highlights from our table included:
• Mariscos Fritos : A generous portion of perfectly fried calamari, shrimp, and vegetables served in a fun metal bucket. The accompanying dipping sauces, including a bright jalapeño crema and a smoky tomato-based sauce, added bold flavor to each bite.
• Lechon Benedict: A Cuban twist on classic Eggs Benedict featuring slow-roasted pork atop toasted bread with perfectly poached eggs and a rich hollandaise, served with mixed greens and crispy breakfast potatoes. Absolutely divine.
• Lechon Asado: Tender, flavorful roast pork with garlic mojo, sautéed onions, black beans, rice (congrís), and sweet plantains. It was both comforting and well-seasoned—every element complemented the other.
• Empanadas & Caribbean Fries: The empanadas were golden and crisp with flavorful fillings. The fries were served in adorable mini pails and paired with a punchy dipping sauce—definitely a crowd-pleaser.
The overall atmosphere was vibrant and festive, perfect for a celebratory brunch. Service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
Final Verdict: Habana delivered on every level—ambience, service, and especially the food. The $85 prix fixe was well worth it given the portion sizes and quality. We left full, happy, and already planning a return visit. Highly recommend for special occasions or just a unique, flavor-packed brunch experience

I have never been to a Cuban restaurant before and this place set the bar really high. The food was so incredibly delicious. I had a salmon plate with rice and plantain and the salmon was so exquisitely seasoned. Their drinks are also some of the best I've had. I highly recommend. Parking is tough, but the food and atmosphere are totally worth a visit.

What a cool restaurant that has open spaces. Staff was very attentive and the food was authentic and delicious. We sampled many appetizers.

It's been a while since we've been here (probably 5 years or more), so we decided to stop in during OC restaurant week. I'm so glad that we did. The food was as good as I remember, if not better! The waiter was attentive and had a good personality, and the ambiance was great. We sat out on the patio, which is really nice on a sunny, warm day. I personally prefer the ambiance at night as it feels a little more upscale due to the dim lighting and decor.
We started off with the Chicken Empanadas and the Bocaditos De Picadillo. Both dishes were really good and we enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the pastry.
For my main dish , I got the Lechon Frito, which isn't on the regular menu. It was excellent. The pork was so succulent and juicy, and the rice was amazing. My girlfriend got the Tamal En Cueza. This isn't like a traditional Tamale, but it was a little bit better, in my opinion, in that the corn masa was more like Italian polenta style.
Overall, it was a great experience and will definitely be going back. Hopefully sooner than later.

I made a reservation about a month and a half in advance and had plenty of time slot options for the day after Valentine’s Day. I received a text 10 minutes before my reservation letting me know that my table was ready, and we were seated immediately upon arrival—I really appreciated the efficiency.
Our table was next to a cute display with candles, adding to the cozy ambiance. We loved the dim lighting, the hanging plants, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, both inside and out. The music was great and really complemented the vibe.
For drinks, my boyfriend ordered a piña colada, and I had a non-alcoholic mojito—both were delicious. We started with the ceviche, which was fresh and paired perfectly with the crispy plantain chips. For our entrées, I had the roasted chicken with rice and beans, while my boyfriend ordered the paella. We both enjoyed our meals—while I’ve had better Cuban food, we’d still rate our dishes a solid 8/10. We ended the meal by sharing the key lime pie, which was absolutely incredible.
Our server was attentive, provided excellent recommendations, and paced our courses perfectly. Overall, we had a great dining experience and would definitely return!

Came here for Thanksgiving dinner. We had a 3 course menu. Majority of dishes tasted great, some meats were a bit dry and chewy though
The atmosphere is casual cozy - overall great upscale cuban restaurant
